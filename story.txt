So there I was, sitting at the flughafen waiting for the plane to start boarding
when I noticed the most ridiculous thing.
A real life demon who calls himself, the demon of Klimaanlage, is complaining at the front desk about his flight being delayed.
Also there were remnants of an apple cake in the air conditioner.
My hunger for brot started to fill my stomach more and more with the smell.
