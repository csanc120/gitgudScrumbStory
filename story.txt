So there I was, sitting at the flughafen waiting for the plane to start boarding when I noticed the most ridiculous thing.
A real life demon who calls himself, the Demon of Lederhose, is complaining at the front desk about his flight being delayed.
Also there were remnants of an apple cake in the air conditioner.
My hunger for brot started to fill my stomach more and more with the smell of Apfelkuchen.
Sadly, the brot was behind a Schloss in someone's BMW.
I felt like visiting the Baeckerei while waiting to see the local hund. 
Luckily, there was a biergarten right next to the baeckerei in the flughafen, what a treat!
