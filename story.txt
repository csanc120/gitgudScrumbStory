So there I was, sitting at the flughafen waiting for the plane to start boarding
when I noticed the most ridiculous thing.
A real life demon who calls himself Klimaanlage, is complaining at the front desk about his flight being delayed.
Also there were remnants of an apple cake in the air conditioner.
